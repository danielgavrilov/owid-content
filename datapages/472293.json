The report determines the input of CO2 to the atmosphere by emissions from human activities, balanced by output (storage) in the carbon reservoirs on land or in the ocean. Thanks to the Global Carbon Budget, the research community can better understand and monitor the global carbon cycle, while the report provides a highly valuable resource within a climate policy framework.</p><p>The Global Carbon Budget is done by the researchers of the Global Carbon Project (GCP), including scientists from the ICOS community. The Global Carbon Budget relies on the ICOS data that is available in different global data networks, such as the World Meteorological Organization's Global Atmosphere Watch (WMO GAW) and Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT).<em>More details at https://www.icos-cp.eu/science-and-impact/global-carbon-budget.</em></p>",
