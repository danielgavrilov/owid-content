        "content": "<p>This data relates to  production-based CO2 emissions. This is the metric typically reported by countries, and the method used to set targets and monitor progress towards them. It does not adjust for emissions embedded in traded goods. It allocates emissions to each country on the basis of where the CO2 was emitted. For example, If China burns coal to produce goods that are then sold and shipped to the UK, these emissions are allocated to China.<p><p>We also provide data on consumption-based CO2 emissions. This does adjust for emissions embedded in traded goods and services. Emissions are allocated to the country where the final goods are used. In the example above, the emissions would instead be allocated to the UK.</p>   <p>Unless specified as consumption-based emissions in our charts or data, it is production-based CO2 emissions that are being used.</p>"

        "content": "<p>Until the 2022 update of the Global Carbon Budget, national emissions data was only available for CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industrial processes (such as cement production). It did not include emissions from land use change.</p><p>The 2022 update – for the first time – includes land use estimates for countries, extending back to 1750.</p><p>The quality of these estimates is better for some countries than others. In our chart here we show the project’s assessment of the data quality for each country.</p><p>Since the estimates of emissions for fossil fuels and industry are much more certain than for land use change, we still adopt the former as our main CO2 emissions metric. However, we now also include charts on land use change, and combined emissions from fossil fuels, industry and land use.</p>"
