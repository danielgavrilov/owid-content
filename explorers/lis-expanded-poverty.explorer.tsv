	$1 a day - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_dhi_eq_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is disposable household income.

	40% of median DHI - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_40_median_dhi_eq	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median disposable household income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is disposable household income.

	$1 a day - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_dhi_pc_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is disposable household income.

	$1 a day - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_dhci_eq_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is disposable household cash income.

	40% of median DHI - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_40_median_dhci_eq	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median disposable household income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is disposable household cash income.

	$1 a day - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_dhci_pc_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day.

It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero.

It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is disposable household cash income.

	$1 a day - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_mi_eq_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is market income.

The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

	$1 a day - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_mi_pc_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is market income.

	40% of median DHI - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_40_median_mi_pc	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median disposable household income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is market income.

	$1 a day - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_hcexp_eq_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day.

It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

	$1 a day - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_hcexp_pc_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is total consumption.

	40% of median DHI - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_40_median_hcexp_pc	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median disposable household income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is total consumption.
