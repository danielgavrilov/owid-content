	900429	Nitrogen oxide emissions	Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are gases that are mainly formed during the burning of fossil fuels. Exposure to NOx gases can have negative impacts on respiratory health. NOx gases can also lead to the formation of ozone – another air pollutant.	Nitrogen oxides (NOx)	From all sectors (Total)	false	true	0	owid-distinct	LineChart	true
	900430	Sulphur dioxide emissions	Sulphur dioxide (SO₂) is an air pollutant formed from the burning of fuels that contain sulphur, such as coal. SO₂ is one of the main chemicals that forms acid rain.	Sulphur dioxide (SO₂)	From all sectors (Total)	false	true	0	owid-distinct	LineChart	true
	900431	Carbon monoxide emissions	Carbon monoxide (CO) is a pollutant produced from the incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels such as oil, gas, wood, and coal.	Carbon monoxide (CO)	From all sectors (Total)	false	true	0	owid-distinct	LineChart	true
	900432	Organic carbon emissions	Organic carbon molecules are formed from the incomplete burning of organic materials. This can come from the burning of fossil fuels (which are carbon-based organic material) or biomass. Organic carbon aerosols can also be suspended in the air from sources such as vehicle tyres and roads. Organic carbon molecules can contribute to particulate matter pollution, with negative impacts on human health.	Organic carbon (OC)	From all sectors (Total)	false	true	0	owid-distinct	LineChart	true
	900433	Emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds	Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are pollutants formed from the burning of biomass and fossil fuels. NMVOCs can lead to the formation of other local air pollutants, such as ozone.	NMVOCs	From all sectors (Total)	false	true	0	owid-distinct	LineChart	true
	900434	Black carbon emissions	Black carbon (BC) is a soot-like pollutant formed from the burning of biomass and fossil fuels. It is a major contributor to particulate matter pollution, and contributes to climate change by absorbing sunlight.	Black carbon (BC)	From all sectors (Total)	false	true	0	owid-distinct	LineChart	true
	900435	Ammonia emissions	Ammonia (NH₃) is a gas which can mix with other gases – such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide – to form particulate matter. Its main sources are the use of manure and fertilizers in agriculture, and emissions from industry.	Ammonia (NH₃)	From all sectors (Total)	false	true	0	owid-distinct	LineChart	true
	900436	Per capita nitrogen oxide emissions	Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are gases that are mainly formed during the burning of fossil fuels. Exposure to NOx gases can have negative impacts on respiratory health. NOx gases can also lead to the formation of ozone – another air pollutant.	Nitrogen oxides (NOx)	From all sectors (Total)	true	true	0	owid-distinct	LineChart	true
	900437	Per capita sulphur dioxide emissions	Sulphur dioxide (SO₂) is an air pollutant formed from the burning of fuels that contain sulphur, such as coal. SO₂ is one of the main chemicals that forms acid rain.	Sulphur dioxide (SO₂)	From all sectors (Total)	true	true	0	owid-distinct	LineChart	true
	900438	Per capita carbon monoxide emissions	Carbon monoxide (CO) is a pollutant produced from the incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels such as oil, gas, wood, and coal.	Carbon monoxide (CO)	From all sectors (Total)	true	true	0	owid-distinct	LineChart	true
	900439	Per capita organic carbon emissions	Organic carbon molecules are formed from the incomplete burning of organic materials. This can come from the burning of fossil fuels (which are carbon-based organic material) or biomass. Organic carbon aerosols can also be suspended in the air from sources such as vehicle tyres and roads. Organic carbon molecules can contribute to particulate matter pollution, with negative impacts on human health.	Organic carbon (OC)	From all sectors (Total)	true	true	0	owid-distinct	LineChart	true
	900440	Per capita emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds	Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are pollutants formed from the burning of biomass and fossil fuels. NMVOCs can lead to the formation of other local air pollutants, such as ozone.	NMVOCs	From all sectors (Total)	true	true	0	owid-distinct	LineChart	true
	900441	Per capita black carbon emissions	Black carbon (BC) is a soot-like pollutant formed from the burning of biomass and fossil fuels. It is a major contributor to particulate matter pollution, and contributes to climate change by absorbing sunlight.	Black carbon (BC)	From all sectors (Total)	true	true	0	owid-distinct	LineChart	true
