	$1 a day - poverty gap index (PIP)	poverty_gap_index_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.	%	%	10;20;30;40;50;60;70;80;90;100	RdPu	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP) (2022)	World Bank.

	40% of median - poverty gap index (PIP)	poverty_gap_index_40_median	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income or consumption. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.	%	%	3;6;9;12;15;18;21	YlOrBr	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP) (2022)	World Bank.

	$1 a day - poverty gap index (LIS)	poverty_gap_index_mi_eq_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day.

It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

	40% of median income - poverty gap index (LIS)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_mi_eq	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is market income.

	$1 a day - poverty gap index (LIS)	poverty_gap_index_mi_pc_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is market income.

	$1 a day - poverty gap index (LIS)	poverty_gap_index_dhi_eq_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is disposable household income.

	40% of median income - poverty gap index (LIS)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_dhi_eq	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is disposable household income.

	$1 a day - poverty gap index (LIS)	poverty_gap_index_dhi_pc_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is disposable household income.

	40% of median income - poverty gap index (LIS)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_dhi_pc	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>This is disposable household income.
