Both sources are updated weekly.</p><p>We do not use the data from some countries in WMD because they fail to meet the following data quality criteria: 1) at least three years of historical data; and 2) data published either weekly or monthly. The full list of excluded countries and reasons for exclusion can be found in this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JPMtzsx-smO3_K4ReK_HMeuVLEzVZ71qHghSuAfG788/edit?usp=sharing.</p><p>For a full list of source information (i.e., HMD or WMD) country by country, see: https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid#source-information-country-by-country.</p><p>We calculate P-scores using the reported deaths data from HMD and WMD and the projected deaths for 2020 from WMD (which we use for all countries and regions, including for deaths broken down by age group). The P-score is the percentage difference between the reported number of weekly or monthly deaths in 2020â€“2021 and the projected number of deaths for the same period based on previous years.</p><p>We calculate the number of weekly deaths for the United Kingdom by summing the weekly deaths from England & Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.</p><p>For important issues and caveats to understand when interpreting excess mortality data, see our excess mortality page at https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid.</p><p>For a more detailed description of the HMD data, including week date definitions, the coverage (of individuals, locations, and time), whether dates are for death occurrence or registration, the original national source information, and important caveats, see the HMD metadata file at https://www.mortality.org/Public/STMF_DOC/STMFmetadata.pdf.</p><p>For a more detailed description of the WMD data, including original source information, see their GitHub page at https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality.</p>	30	-50	-25,#74add1,;-10,#abd9e9,;0,#e0f3f8,;10,#ffffbf,;25,#fee090,;50,#fdae61,;100,#f46d43,;200,#d73027,			true	RdYlBu	true
