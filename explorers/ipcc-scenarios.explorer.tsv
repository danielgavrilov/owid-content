For example, the energy stored in coal or oil before combustion in a power plant. The transformation of fossil fuels into their secondary form (such as electricity) results in large inefficiencies due to heat loss. This means primary energy is higher than the energy used by a population.	Primary energy	Gas (with CCS)	Share of total	OECD	oecd	primary_energy_share_gas_ccs		Riahi et al. (2017).
