Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, Blavatnik School of Government.			<p>OxCGRT collects publicly available information on indicators of government response. These indicators take policies such as school closures, travel bans, etc. and record them on an ordinal scale; the remainder are financial indicators such as fiscal or monetary measures.<p>OxCGRT measures the variation in governments’ responses using its 'COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index (Stringency Index)'. This composite measure is a simple additive score of nine indicators measured on an ordinal scale, rescaled to vary from 0 to 100. Please note that this measure is for comparative purposes only, and should not necessarily be interpreted as a rating of the appropriateness or effectiveness of a country's response.<p>It also includes a measure of 'COVID-19 Containment and Health Response' index which is based on the metrics used in the 'Stringency Index' plus testing policy and contact tracing.<p>Note: This is an ongoing collation project of live data. If you see any inaccuracies in the underlying data please contact us on the feedback form below. The underlying index is evolving as the situation and data evolves from country to country, and will change over time as the data gets more accurate.

Tracking R of COVID-19: A New Real-Time Estimation Using the Kalman Filter			<p>The effective reproduction rate (R) is the average number of secondary cases produced by each infectious case in a population made up of both susceptible and non-susceptible hosts. If the effective reproduction rate is greater than 1, the number of cases will increase. For example, an effective reproduction rate of 2 indicates that the average person with a confirmed case of COVID-19 will infect 2 other people.</p><p>Estimates of the effective reproduction rate for COVID-19 are provided by: Arroyo-Marioli, Bullano, Kucinskas, and Rondón-Moreno (2020).
