	Gini coefficient	gini	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	The Gini coefficient measures inequality on a scale between 0 and 1, where higher values indicate greater inequality.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)			5	Numeric	0	0.2;0.25;0.3;0.35;0.4;0.45;0.5;0.55;0.6;0.65;0.7	true	Reds
	Share of the richest decile in total income or expenditure	decile10_share	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	The income or expenditure of the richest decile (tenth of the population) as a share of total income or expenditure.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)	%	%	5	Numeric	0	0;5;10;15;20;25;30;35;40;45;50	true	Greens
	P90/P10 ratio	p90_p10_ratio	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	P90 is the the level of income or expenditure below which 90% of the population lives. P10 is the level of income or expenditure below which 10% of the population lives. This variable gives the ratio of the two. It is a measure of inequality that indicates the gap between the richest and poorest tenth of the population. It tells you how many times richer someone just in the the poorest tenth would need to be in order to be counted in the richest tenth.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP), adapted by Our World in Data.			5	Numeric	0	0;2;4;6;8;10;12;14;16;18	true	OrRd
	P90/P50 ratio	p90_p50_ratio	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	P90 is the the level of income or expenditure above which 10% of the population lives. P50 is the median – the level of income or expenditure below which 50% of the population lives. This variable gives the ratio of the two. It is a measure of inequality within the top half of the distribution. It tells you how many times richer someone in the middle of the distribution would need to be in order to be counted in the richest tenth.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP), adapted by Our World in Data.			5	Numeric	0	0;2;4;6;8;10;12;14;16;18	true	Purples
	P50/P10 ratio	p50_p10_ratio	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	P50 is the median – the level of income or expenditure below which 50% of the population lives. P10 is the the level of income or expenditure below which 10% of the population lives. This variable gives the ratio of the two. It is a measure of inequality within the bottom half of the distribution. It tells you how many times richer someone just in the the poorest tenth would need to be in order to be reach the median.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP), adapted by Our World in Data.			5	Numeric	0	0;2;4;6;8;10;12;14;16;18	true	YlOrRd
	Palma ratio	palma_ratio	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	The Palma ratio is a measure of inequality: it is the share of total income or expenditure of the top 10% divided by the share of the bottom 40%.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP), adapted by Our World in Data.			5	Numeric	0	0;2;4;6;8;10;12;14;16;18	true	Oranges

	Mean Log Deviation	mld	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	The mean log deviation (MLD) is a measure of inequality. An MLD of zero indicates perfect equality and it takes on larger positive values as incomes become more unequal. The measure is also referred to as 'Theil L' or 'GE(0)', in reference to the wider families of inequality measures to which the MLD belongs.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)			5	Numeric	0	0;2;4;6;8;10;12;14;16;18	true	RdPu
	Polarization index	polarization	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	The polarization index, also known as the Wolfson polarization index, measures the extent to which the distribution of income or expenditure is “spread out” and bi-modal. Like the Gini coefficient, the polarization index ranges from 0 (no polarization) to 1 (complete polarization). The polarization index is based on Wolfson (1994) and Ravallion and Chen (1997). See Wolfson, Michael C. 1994. “When Inequalities Diverge.” The American Economic Review 84 (2): 353–58. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117858 and Ravallion, Martin, and Shaohua Chen. 1997. “What Can New Survey Data Tell Us about Recent Changes in Distribution and Poverty?” The World Bank Economic Review 11 (2): 357–82. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3990232.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)			5	Numeric	0	0;2;4;6;8;10;12;14;16;18	true	Reds
